# simple-java-maven-app

The repository contains a simple Java application which outputs the string
"Hello world!" and is accompanied by a couple of unit tests to check that the
main application works as expected. The results of these tests are saved to a
JUnit XML report.

The `scripts` directory contains a shell script with commands that are executed 
when Bamboo processes the "Deliver" stage of your Plan.
